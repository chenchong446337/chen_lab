    "text": "Motivation:\nMy career began in the demanding setting of an operating room, where I became deeply intrigued by the powerful and somewhat mysterious nature of general anesthesia. This fascination led me to transition from anesthesiology to neuroscience, aiming to make my own contribution to our understanding of the intricately interconnected neurobiology of pain, opioids, and anesthesia.\nThis fascination was profoundly deepened by a personal and unforgettable experience—witnessing anesthesia awareness, one of the most harrowing complications in general anesthesia. If you’re not familiar with anesthesia awareness, I encourage you to watch the trailer for the movie Awake below. It conveys how truly distressing and traumatic this experience can be, and it has deeply motivated me to explore and understand more about general anesthesia.\n\n\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

    "text": "Future work:\nMy command of both hands-on techniques and computational skills enables me to investigate the neurobiology of pain, opioids, and anesthesia, from nano-scale molecules to meter-scale systems. Below, I briefly describe three specific areas of research focus for my lab in the next five years.\n\n\nThe cerebellum in pain\n\nMy postdoctoral work revealed the involvement of the cerebellum in placebo analgesia, aligning with a growing body of evidence demonstrating cerebellar activation during pain (Michelle Welman et al., 2018; Moulton et al., 2010). However, an intriguing question arises: How does the cerebellum, a brain structure primarily associated with motor functions, participate in pain perception? In my laboratory, I will continue to explore the role of the cerebellum, as well as the endogenous opioid system within the cerebellum (see below), in placebo analgesia. Additionally, I will investigate how the cerebellum contributes to pain sensation and pain chronification.\nBy exploring the role of the cerebellum in pain perception, we could not only challenge traditional paradigms and offer new perspectives on neural processing, but open new avenues for pain management and therapeutic interventions.\n\n\n\n\nEndogenous opioid system in the cerebellum for pain and mental disorders\n\nTraditionally, the cerebellum was considered a negative control for opioid expression. However, recent single-cell RNA sequencing data, along with my histological findings (see below), confirm the expression of various opioid peptides and receptors in the cerebellum. Whether they play a significant role in pain perception remains unclear. Additionally, growing evidence implicates the endogenous opioid system in anxiety and depression (Peciña et al., 2019). For instance, global DOR knockout mice exhibit anxiety and depression symptoms (Filliol et al., 2000), while the removal of DOR specifically from inhibitory neurons in the forebrain induces anxiety phenotypes (Chu Sin Chung et al., 2015). This highlights the multifaceted roles of DOR+ neurons across different brain regions and neuron types in the context of anxiety and depression. Interestingly, DOR+ neurons in the cerebellum are excitatory, which may contribute to the antidepressant effect observed in global DOR knockout mice.\nIn my laboratory, I will investigate the role of the endogenous opioid system in the cerebellum in relation to pain, several mental disorders, and addiction, which could significantly advance our understanding of the role of the cerebellum in these non-motor functions and potentially lead to novel therapeutic targets.\n\n\n\n\nNeural basis of anesthesia emergence\n\nAnesthesia emergence (AE) represents the critical final stage of general anesthesia, marking the patient’s transition from unconsciousness to wakefulness. Achieving a smooth and safe emergence is a primary goal for anesthesiologists, yet this phase can be accompanied by a range of undesirable complications, such as emergence delirium in children with an incidence of 50-80%, and delayed emergence prevalent in patients older than 60 years. Recent studies have demonstrated that the neural circuits controlling AE are distinct from those involved in anesthesia induction (Cascella et al. 2018; Tarnal et al. 2016). However, the neurobiology underlying AE remains largely unexplored.\nTo investigate the neural substrate underlying anesthesia emergence (AE), I have utilized an activity-dependent genetic tagging technique to label neurons active during AE. This experiment has generated intriguing preliminary data (see below) suggesting that numerous neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) display increased activity during anesthesia emergence.\nThese studies aim to provide valuable insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AE. These findings could lead to targeted interventions enabling anesthesiologists to better control the process of AE, enhancing overall clinical care in the field of anesthesia."

The miniscope is a compact, head-mounted fluorescence microscope designed for in vivo Ca²⁺ imaging in freely moving mice. It enables real-time observation of neuronal activity at the cellular level, offering high spatial and temporal resolution. The miniscope’s lightweight and portable design minimizes behavioral interference, making it ideal for studying neural circuits in naturalistic settings. It allows for long-term recordings in freely behaving animals, capturing the dynamics of neural activity during complex tasks.\n\n\n\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.

Try downloading it instead: Download the video. \n\nIn vivo calcium imaging of neuronal activity in freely moving mice (Chen et al., 2024).\n\n\nElectrophysiology (paired recording)\nWhole-cell patch clamp is a technique to study ion channel activity and cellular electrical properties. Paired whole-cell recordings, where two cells are simultaneously patched, allow precise analysis of synaptic transmission and connectivity. This approach enables researchers to measure pre- and postsynaptic responses in real-time, offering insights into circuit dynamics, synaptic strength, and plasticity. Advantages include high temporal and spatial resolution, the ability to control intracellular environments, and direct access to synaptic interactions. It is particularly valuable in neuroscience for investigating synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and functional connectivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaired recording of connected basket cells (BC) and Purkinje cells (PC) in the cerebellum, showing both their activity and how BC firing influences PC firing (Chen et al., 2017a,b).\n\n\nViral neuronal tracing\nViral tracing is a powerful technique to map neural circuits by utilizing genetically engineered viruses to label neurons and their connections. Anterograde tracing labels downstream targets by transporting the virus from the cell body along axons to synaptic terminals, revealing outputs of specific neurons. Retrograde tracing, on the other hand, maps inputs by transporting the virus from axon terminals back to the originating cell bodies, identifying presynaptic neurons. Advanced viral tools, such as rabies and AAV vectors, enable cell-type-specific tracing, functional manipulation, and circuit mapping at single-neuron resolution, providing insights into the organization and connectivity of complex neural networks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAV-mediated anterograde tracing (left) and rabies virus-mediated retrograde tracing (right) (Chen et al., 2024).\n\n\nActivity-dependent genetic labeling\nActivity-dependent tagging methods, such as TRAP (Targeted Recombination in Active Populations), are cutting-edge tools for labeling and studying neurons activated during specific experiences or stimuli. TRAP uses a combination of an immediate early gene promoter, such as Fos, and CreER technology to drive conditional gene expression in active neurons upon exposure to tamoxifen. This allows for precise temporal control of labeling, capturing neurons based on their activity at specific moments. TRAP is invaluable for dissecting functional circuits, enabling researchers to manipulate, trace, or analyze activated neuronal populations, shedding light on the neural basis of behaviors, memory, and sensory processing.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabeling neurons active during pain stimulation using TRAP2 mice (Chen et al., 2023).\n\n\n\nSingle-cell RNA seq and RNAscope\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a cutting-edge method for analyzing gene expression in individual cells, providing detailed insights into cellular diversity, gene networks, and functional states. By capturing and sequencing RNA from single cells, it enables the discovery of novel cell types and understanding of dynamic biological processes. In situ hybridization (ISH) is a complementary technique used to validate scRNA-seq findings by visualizing specific RNA transcripts in their spatial context within tissues. ISH provides direct evidence of gene expression at the cellular level, linking molecular data to anatomical structures and ensuring the accuracy of transcriptomic analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\nClassifying Pn neurons based on their transcriptomic profiles (Chen et al., 2024).\n\n\n\nOptogenetics and chemogenetics\nOptogenetics and chemogenetics are advanced tools for manipulating neuronal activity with high precision. Optogenetics uses light-sensitive proteins, such as channelrhodopsins and halorhodopsins, to activate or inhibit neurons via light, offering millisecond-level temporal resolution. It is widely used to probe the causal relationship between neuronal activity and behavior. Chemogenetics employs engineered receptors, such as DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs), which are activated by specific ligands, enabling more prolonged and spatially targeted modulation of neuronal activity. Both techniques provide valuable insights into neural circuits and behavior, with optogenetics excelling in temporal precision and chemogenetics in long-lasting effects.\n\n\n\n\n\nManipulating neuronal activity using optogenetics in both in vivo and in vitro settings (Chen et al., 2024)."
