## Motivation:

My career began in the demanding setting of an operating room, where I became deeply intrigued by the powerful and somewhat mysterious nature of general anesthesia. This fascination led me to transition from anesthesiology to neuroscience, aiming to make my own contribution to our understanding of the intricately interconnected neurobiology of pain, opioids, and anesthesia.

This fascination was deepened by my experiences as an anesthesiologist, witnessing the complexities of general anesthesia and rare but profound complications like anesthesia awareness—dramatically depicted in the movie **Awake** below.

## Future work:

My command of both hands-on techniques and computational skills enables me to investigate the neurobiology of pain, opioids, and anesthesia, from nano-scale molecules to meter-scale systems. Below, I briefly describe three specific areas of research focus for my lab in the next five years.

<ol>

<li>

<strong>The cerebellum in pain</strong>

<p>My postdoctoral work revealed the involvement of the cerebellum in placebo analgesia, consistent with a growing body of evidence demonstrating the activation of the cerebellum during pain (Michelle Welman et al., 2018; Moulton et al., 2010). However, an intriguing question arises: How does the cerebellum, a brain structure known for its motor functions, participate in pain perception?</p>

<li>

<strong>Opioids in the cerebellum for pain and mental disorders</strong>

<p>
Traditionally, the cerebellum was considered a negative control for opioid expression. However, recent single-cell RNA-sequence data and my histological data confirm the expression of various opioid peptides and receptors in the cerebellum. Whether they play an important role in pain perception is not clear. Additionally, growing evidence implicates the endogenous opioid system in anxiety and depression (Peciña et al., 2019). Global DOR knockout mice exhibit anxiety and depression symptoms (Filliol et al., 2000). However, the removal of DOR specifically from inhibitory neurons in the forebrain induces anxiety phenotypes (Chu Sin Chung et al., 2015). This highlights the multifaceted roles of DOR+ neurons across different brain regions and neuron types in the context of anxiety and depression.

<strong>Neural basis of anesthesia emergence</strong>

<p>

Anesthesia emergence (AE) represents the critical final stage of general anesthesia, marking the patient's transition from unconsciousness to wakefulness. Achieving a smooth and safe emergence is a primary goal for anesthesiologists, yet this phase can be accompanied by a range of undesirable complications, such as emergence delirium in children with an incidence of 50-80%, and delayed emergence prevalent in patients older than 60 years. Recent studies have demonstrated that the neural circuits controlling AE are distinct from those involved in anesthesia induction (Cascella et al. 2018; Tarnal et al. 2016). However, the neurobiology underlying AE remains largely unexplored.

To investigate the neural substrate underlying anesthesia emergence (AE), I have utilized an activity-dependent genetic tagging technique to label neurons active during AE. This experiment has generated intriguing preliminary data (Fig.3) suggesting that numerous neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) display increased activity during anesthesia emergence.
